        ## **Thanks for contributing!** 😊

        We truly appreciate your time and effort. If this is your first open-source contribution, welcome!

        This template is designed to help you create a **Good First Issue (GFI)** —
        a small, well-scoped task that helps new contributors learn the
        **Hiero C++ SDK** codebase and workflow.

      description: Who is this issue for?
      value: |
        This issue is especially welcoming for people who are new to contributing to the **Hiero C++ SDK**.

        We know that opening your first pull request can feel like a big step.  
        Issues labeled **Good First Issue** are designed to make that experience easier, clearer, and more comfortable.

        No prior knowledge of Hiero, Hedera, or distributed ledger technology is required.  
        Just a basic familiarity with C++ and Git is more than enough to get started.

        Describe the issue in a way that’s easy for new contributors to understand.
        Please avoid assuming prior knowledge of the codebase, Hiero, or distributed ledgers.
        Links to relevant files or examples are always helpful.

        ## 👾 Description of the Issue — Example (C++)

        The file:

        ```src/sdk/main/src/TokenAssociateTransaction.cc```

        
        contains several small helper methods used by
        `TokenAssociateTransaction`.
        
        Some local variable names inside these methods are abbreviated
        and not immediately clear to new contributors.
        
        For example, variables like `txBody` and `acctId` are used without
        additional context, which can make the code harder to read when
        learning the SDK.
        
        The code works correctly, but improving variable naming would make
        the file easier to understand and maintain.

        ## 💡 Proposed Solution — Example
        
        Rename a small number of local variables in
        `TokenAssociateTransaction.cc` to use clearer, more descriptive names.
        
        The changes should:
        - Not modify any logic or behavior
        - Not change public APIs
        - Be limited to local variable names only
        - Improve readability for new contributors
