      description: Who is this issue for?
      value: |
        This issue is especially welcoming for people who are new to contributing to the **Hiero C++ SDK**.

        We know that opening your first pull request can feel like a big step.  
        Issues labeled **Good First Issue** are designed to make that experience easier, clearer, and more comfortable.

        No prior knowledge of Hiero, Hedera, or distributed ledger technology is required.  
        Just a basic familiarity with C++ and Git is more than enough to get started.

        Describe the issue in a way that’s easy for new contributors to understand.
        Please avoid assuming prior knowledge of the codebase, Hiero, or distributed ledgers.
        Links to relevant files or examples are always helpful.

        ## 👾 Description of the Issue — Example (C++)

        The file:

        ```src/sdk/main/src/TokenAssociateTransaction.cc```

        
        contains several short methods that are part of the
        `TokenAssociateTransaction` implementation.
        
        Some of these methods lack brief comments explaining their purpose,
        which can make the file harder to understand for new contributors
        who are unfamiliar with the SDK.
        
        For example, methods like `submitRequest()` and `addToBody()` are
        correctly implemented, but their intent is not immediately obvious
        without reading surrounding code.
        
        The behavior is correct, but adding small, clear comments would
        make the file easier to read and maintain.

        ## 💡 Proposed Solution — Example
        
        Add short, descriptive comments above selected methods in
        `TokenAssociateTransaction.cc` explaining what each method does
        and when it is used.
        
        The changes should:
        - Not modify any existing logic
        - Not change behavior or public APIs
        - Be limited to comments only
        - Help new contributors understand the flow of the file
