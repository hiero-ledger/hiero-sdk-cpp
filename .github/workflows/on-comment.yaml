name: Bot - On Comment

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Workflow: Bot - On Comment
#
# Purpose:
#   Runs when a NEW comment is created on an issue. Dispatches to
#   bot-on-comment.js which parses slash commands (e.g. /assign) from
#   the comment body and runs the appropriate handler.
#
# Currently supported commands:
#   /assign — Assign the commenter to the issue (see commands/assign.js
#             for eligibility checks: skill prerequisites, assignment
#             limits, required status labels).
#
# Security:
#   - Uses setup-bot composite action which checks out the default
#     branch (never the PR branch) to prevent running untrusted code
#     with the write token.
#   - The if-guard ensures this only fires on issue comments, not on
#     PR review comments (which have a different payload shape).
#
# Concurrency:
#   Serialized per issue number (cancel-in-progress: false) to prevent
#   race conditions when multiple /assign comments arrive in quick
#   succession on the same issue.
