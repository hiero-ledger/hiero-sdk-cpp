# Good First Issue — Candidate  
**Hiero C++ SDK (`hiero-sdk-cpp`)**

The **`good first issue: candidate`** label is a simple way to mark issues that *might* be a great starting point for new contributors, but could benefit from a little more clarity or polish first.

This means the `good first issue: candidate` label helps first-time contributors have the smoothest possible experience.

---

## Why This Label Exists

Some issues look small and approachable, but may still need:

- Clearer instructions  
- More specific file paths  
- Better-defined acceptance criteria  
- A more obvious “next step”  

The candidate label gives maintainers space to add those details before promoting the issue as a full **Good First Issue**.

---

## How It Helps Contributors

When an issue becomes a Good First Issue, the goal is for contributors to feel:

- Confident about what to do  
- Comfortable jumping in  
- Supported by clear, step-by-step guidance  

The candidate stage is just a way to make sure the issue is ready to offer that kind of experience.

---

## When the Candidate Label Is Useful

The label can be helpful when:

- The task seems beginner-friendly  
- But some details are still missing  
- Or the implementation steps aren’t fully clear yet  

It’s a friendly “this is almost ready” marker.

---

## What Candidate Issues Might Look Like

At this stage, an issue might include things like:

- Notes for maintainers to clarify later  
- Rough acceptance criteria  
- “We should probably…” ideas  
- Partial instructions

## A Note on Good First Issue Fit

Github markets `Good First Issues` to new, open-source developers.

This means tasks like:
- Exploration  
- Design choices  
- Debugging  
- Or deeper system knowledge  

Those are still valuable contributions — they’re just better suited labelled as `beginner` or `intermediate` or `advanced`.

---

## Moving from Candidate → Good First Issue

When an issue feels:

- Clear  
- Well-scoped  
- Easy to follow  
- And friendly for first-time contributors  

It can be promoted to a **Good First Issue**.

There’s no rush — taking the time to make an issue welcoming is part of what makes the community stronger.

---

## The Big Picture

The `Good First Issue Candidate` label helps make the C++ SDK friendly for *everyone* — especially new contributors.
