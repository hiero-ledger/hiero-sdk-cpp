        ## **Thanks for contributing!** 😊

        We truly appreciate your time and effort.

        This template is designed to help you create a **Beginner-friendly issue** —
        a moderately easy, well-scoped task that helps contributors build confidence
        and deepen their understanding of the **Hiero C++ SDK** codebase.

      value: |
        This issue is a great fit for contributors who are ready to explore the Hiero C++
        codebase a little more and take on slightly more independent work.

        Beginner Issues often involve reading existing C++ code, understanding how
        different parts of the SDK fit together, and making small, thoughtful updates
        that follow established patterns.

        The goal is to support skill growth while keeping the experience approachable,
        well-scoped, and enjoyable.

        > Beginner Issues are a great next step for contributors who feel comfortable
        > with the basic project workflow and want to explore the codebase a little more.

        > These issues often involve:
        > - Reading existing C++ code  
        > - Understanding how different parts of the SDK fit together  
        > - Making small, thoughtful updates that follow established patterns  
        >
        > You’ll usually see Beginner Issues focused on things like:
        > - Small, well-scoped improvements to existing tests  
        > - Narrow updates to `src` functionality (e.g. refining helpers or improving readability)  
        > - Documentation or comment clarity  
        > - Enhancements to existing examples  
        >
        > Other types of contributions — such as brand-new features, broader system changes,
        > or deeper technical work — are just as valuable and may use different labels.

        Describe the issue in a clear, approachable way.

        Aim to explain the context, what needs to change, and the expected outcome
        without assuming deep knowledge of the codebase. The goal is to make the
        task feel understandable, well-scoped, and encouraging to take on.

        ## 👾 Description of the Issue — Example (C++)

        The `AccountId` class located in:

        ```
        src/sdk/main/include/hiero/account/AccountId.h
        src/sdk/main/src/account/AccountId.cc
        ```

        currently provides a `toString()` method, but when `AccountId` objects are
        logged or inspected during debugging, the output is not very descriptive.

        Improving the readability of this output would make debugging and logging
        easier for developers using the SDK.

        ## 💡 Proposed Solution — Example (C++)

        Update the existing `toString()` method in `AccountId` to produce a more
        descriptive and readable string representation that clearly shows the
        shard, realm, and account number.

        The change should:
        - Preserve existing behavior
        - Avoid public API changes
        - Follow formatting patterns used by other ID classes

        Example output:

        ```
        AccountId{shard=0, realm=0, num=1234}
        ```

        Walk through how to implement the solution in clear, easy-to-follow steps.

        Beginner Issues often leave a little more room for exploration than Good First
        Issues, so it’s helpful to describe the overall approach, key files to look at,
        what to change, and how to check the result.

        ### 👩‍💻 Implementation — Example (C++)

        To implement this improvement:

        - [ ] Locate the `AccountId` class in the `src/` directory
        - [ ] Review the existing `toString()` implementation
        - [ ] Review how other ID classes format their string output
        - [ ] Update `toString()` to:
              - Clearly display `shard`, `realm`, and `num`
              - Use a consistent, readable format
        - [ ] Update or extend existing unit tests to validate the new output
        - [ ] Build the SDK and ensure all tests pass
