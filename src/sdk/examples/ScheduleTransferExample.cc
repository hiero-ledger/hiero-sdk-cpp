  //
  // For example, if Alice wants to transfer an amount of Hbar to Bob, and Bob has receiverSignatureRequired set to
  // true, then that transaction must be signed by both Alice and Bob before the transaction will be executed.
  //
  // To solve this problem, Alice can propose the transaction by creating a scheduled transaction on the Hiero network
  // which, if executed, would transfer Hbar from Alice to Bob.  That scheduled transaction will have a ScheduleId by
  // which we can refer to that scheduled transaction.  Alice can communicate the ScheduleId to Bob, and then Bob can
  // use a ScheduleSignTransaction to sign that scheduled transaction.
  //
  // Bob has a 30 minute window in which to sign the scheduled transaction, starting at the moment that Alice creates
  // the scheduled transaction.  If a scheduled transaction is not signed by all of the necessary signatories within the
  // 30 minute window, that scheduled transaction will expire, and will not be executed.
  //
  // Once a scheduled transaction has all of the signatures necessary to execute, it will be executed on the Hiero
  // network automatically.  If you create a scheduled transaction on the Hiero network, but that transaction only
  // requires your signature in order to execute and no one else's, that scheduled transaction will be automatically
  // executed immediately.
